			<p>To the right are 2 boxes that are absolutely positioned; the lime-green box has a z-index value of 10 and the yellow box has a z-index of 20. The only difference between the boxes is that the yellow box is wrapped in a division that has position:relative and is the first box defined in the sourcecode.</p>
			<p>Basically the fact that the yellow box is wrapped in a relative positioned element should not effect the stacking order: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#z-index">the CSS specification</a> clearly states that only positioned elements that have a computed z-index value other than 'auto' generate a new stacking context. The relative positioned element does not have a z-index value defined, so it should not influence the stacking order of it's child-elements.</p>
			<p>It appears that in Internet Explorer (windows) positioned elements <em>do</em> generate a new stacking context, starting with a z-index value of 0, causing the lime-green box to appear above the yellow box.</p>
			<p>This is a serious violation of the CSS specifications, causing headages and a lot of misunderstanding of what z-index really does.</p>
